acts_as_authenticated generator
====

This is a basic authentication generator for rails, very much in the spirit of xal's original Login Generator.

To use:

  ./script/generate authenticated user account

This generates a basic user model, a controller, some basic views, and tests.  Extra functionality can be unlocked by
removing the comments for them.  I have a few examples such as user activation and reversible encrypted passwords.

Two more generators are provided...

Generate your mailer:

  ./script/generate authenticated_mailer user

Generate a new migration for the user model:

  ./script/generate authenticated_migration add_authenticated_table

Plenty of comments are provided in the source code to help you progress.  Look at the generated account controller 
for examples on using the AuthenticatedSystem mixin, and the account controller functional tests for examples on the
AuthenticatedTestHelper.
