The examples directory contains a working server and consumer that use
the openid libraries.  They are both written using python's standard
BaseHTTPServer.


To run the example system:

1. Make sure you've installed the library, as explained in the
   installation instructions.

2. Start the consumer server:

        python consumer.py --port 8001


3. In another terminal, start the identity server:

        python server.py --port 8000

   (Hit Ctrl-C in either server's window to stop that server.)


4. Open your web broswer, and go to the consumer server:

        http://localhost:8001/

   Note that all pages the consumer server shows will have "Python OpenID
   Consumer Example" across the top.


5. Enter an identity url managed by the sample identity server:

        http://localhost:8000/bob


6. The browser will be redirected to the sample server, which will be
   requesting that you log in to proceed.  Enter the username for the
   identity URL into the login box:

        bob

   Note that all pages the identity server shows will have "Python
   OpenID Server Example" across the top.


7. After you log in as bob, the server example will ask you if you
   want to allow http://localhost:8001/ to know your identity.  Say
   yes.


8. You should end up back on the consumer site, at a page indicating
   you've logged in successfully.


That's a basic OpenID login procedure.  You can continue through it,
playing with variations to see how they work.  The python code is
intended to be a straightforward example of how to use the python
OpenID library to function as either an identity server or consumer.
