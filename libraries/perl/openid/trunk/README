Perl JanRain OpenID Library 1.1.0
=================================
To use this library, put the contents of the lib directory into your
perl path. Currently only the consumer is implemented. Extensive POD
documentation exists in the two modules,
Net/OpenID/JanRain/Consumer.pm and Net/OpenID/JanRain/Server.pm
You will also need a store from Net/OpenID/JanRain/Stores , which
all have PODs too.  We now offer a flat file store and three
different SQL database stores, SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

Dependencies:
Net::Yadis
Digest::HMAC_SHA1
MIME::Base64
LWPx::ParanoidAgent
or LWP::UserAgent (not as secure)
URI
CGI
Crypt::DH
Math::BigInt

It is strongly recommended that you have perl bindings for GMP
installed, or Diffie Hellman exchanges will be unbearably slow
(~10 seconds per step on my 3GHz P4).

/dev/urandom is also required for the library to be secure, although
you may comment out the "die" line if you are okay with running
the consumer insecurely.
