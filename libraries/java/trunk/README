This is the first release of our java openid library.  Expect some rough edges
to remain.  At the moment, javadoc is not being run, but the comments are in
place in the source.

The best spot to see how to begin using this code is in the example war.  Edit
build.xml to set the location of the servlet-api jar file, then run:

  ant example-war

That will create a dist/ directory, which contains a file, openid.war.  Drop
that .war file into the webapps directory of your servlet container, possibly
restart the container, then visit the /openid webapp.  It's a simple one-page
app, that verifies valid OpenIDs.  The source for the webapp is in the example
directory.  In particular, the file:

  examples/WEB-INF/src/com/janrain/openid/example/Consumer.java

is a hopefully straightforward and illustrative example for using the OpenID
library.
